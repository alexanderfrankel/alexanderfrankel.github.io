Days went by without fail, void of fulfillment and creativity. The phone never stopped ringing as I sat trapped behind my desk watching the clock. 1:15..3:00..4:30...while constantly defending against an all out attack from my eyelids as they tried to close shut. I couldn't just quit. Brought in by my brother-in-law, his reputation on the line, expectations from my boss, pressure from my mom. I'll spare you the full list of reasons why I couldn't just walk out the door, but something had to change for G-d's sake!
Dev Bootcamp entered my life via an esteemed colleague and friend. Analyst by trade and a 'boss' by nature, he told me about Dev Bootcamp.

Ever find yourself reading something because you feel like you HAVE to read it, rather than wanting to read it? It's like reading an article in the WSJ that is too long. You look up after spending 45 minutes wading through 4 syllable words with definitions shorter than the words themselves. You ask yourself, "what the fuck am I reading about and why did I spend so much time reading this garbage?"
Reading about Dev Bootcamp was the OPPOSITE! I was hooked, wanting to flip through each article, each FAQ, each blog post in order to see what this Dev (abbreviation for 'developer') + Bootcamp (military training camp for new recruits, with strict discipline) is all about. Not having that experience, that feeling of excitement to learn in a very long time or possibly ever in my life, I applied. That's when Dev Bootcamp began to change me.

From my application: 

"Although if I do get accepted to Dev Bootcamp I will probably hit you with a multitude of random thoughts/ideas, there is
only one that I would like to share at the moment: the importance of this program.

Without question, there is nothing more that I want for myself than to be accepted to Dev Bootcamp. That being said, your
program has already given me something invaluable and exactly what I needed: a calling. Let me explain...
I moved to New York on July 28, 2012 to start work at Merrill Lynch two days later. I entered the wealth management
business with a couple of things: two internships under my belt, an eagerness to succeed, and many doubts about life as a
banker. The past year and a half has been volatile to say the least. At times, I have been moments away from walking out
the door; other times, I have seen the magic and could not imagine doing anything else. My point is that when I found Dev
Bootcamp, I also found a freedom or a calling. The calling that I found is that it is time for me to make a change. When I
was reading your Blog, FAQ page, and "Boots on the Ground", I felt myself glowing because I knew I had discovered an
environment full of love and creativity. Dev Bootcamp showed me that places filled with people with a desire "to work on
what they love until they are too tired to think" (Coding A Path To Your Fullest Self - Scott James) actually exist. I very well
may end up working in finance or even in a bank for the majority of career; however, I will never stop searching for the
beautiful space filled with passion and awareness that Dev Bootcamp has created.

I repeat, there is nothing more that I want for myself than to be accepted to Dev Bootcamp (for the reasons listed in the
question above); however, I am thankful for what it has already given me."

One week and a 30 minute interview later, I was accepted. My journey as a software developer had begun; however, that's all it done. Nothing could have possibly hinted at what was to come.
