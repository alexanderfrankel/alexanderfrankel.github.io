Expression. Self-Awareness. Creativity. Honesty. Opinion. Peace.

I am starting this blog to create a safe space for the values listed above. Upon entering the world, I was met with structure, interpretation, and direction. This blog will give me a way to reach into the depths of mind and translate whatever I find into written words on the page. Isn't that something that everyone strives for? A place for release. A place of non-judgement.

That does not go to say that I will not be judged by my words or even criticized for thinking them; however, as I type these words in THIS moment, they are not met with judgement or criticism, but rather with a medium for expression and ultimately peace.

That being said, please feel free to comment however you wish whether it be through email, phone, postal mail, twitter, facebook, walking down the street, or complete social outcast. My purpose is not to ignite controversy or even to social disruption, but to simply expand in whichever way my fingers typing on the keyboard allow.

Thanks,
Alexander Lewis Frankel
